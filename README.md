# Uniti Plugins [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/UnitiApp/uniti-plugins.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/UnitiApp/uniti-plugins)

## Description ##
The plugins included in this repository are available to use with [UnitiApp](https://github.com/UnitiApp/uniti). They may include user-submitted plugins as well. Since they are [backbone views](http://backbonejs.org/#View), there's no reason why they coudn't be used in other projects as well.

Each plugin contains a markdown documenting how to use it. The options the plugins provide, will be initialized in your [Uniti config.json file](https://github.com/UnitiApp/uniti/blob/master/public/config/config.json).

## Contributing ##
